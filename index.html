            <h2>To Remain Aware of the Graphic Design Principles During the Web Design Process</h2>
            <p>From September 10 to November 15, 2024, I had the opportunity to intern at FraSca Design Group, a creative agency based
            in Mineola, New York, specializing in branding, print, and digital design. Although my academic concentration is in web design and
            development, I pursued this internship in Graphic Design to strengthen my visual design skills and better prepare myself
            for a future in web design and development. Throughout this experience, I gained a deeper understanding of the design
            process, learned new industry-standard tools, and improved my ability to communicate visually—all of which are essential
            skills for a competent and creative web designer.</p><br>

                <h4>A Better Use of the Design Principles</h4>
                <p>At FraSca Design Group, I worked under the supervision of one senior designer / artistic director and collaborated
                    with a multidisciplinary team that included 2 project managers/developers. My daily task mainly consisted of
                    redesigning social media post mockups and contents meant to promote client companies, mainly restaurants and law
                    firms.<br><br>
                    One completely new skill I learned there was to rely on the artificial intelligence to generate text content. However,
                    it is fair to affirm that my work there included:<br><br>
                    • Assisting in designing digital and print materials such as brochures, posters, and social media assets.<br>
                    • Creating mockups and visual layouts using Canva Pro (But, I used Adobe Creative Suite, primarily Photoshop,
                    Illustrator, and InDesign to build design proposals to the team).<br>
                    • Participating in team meetings and client presentations.<br>
                    • Learning about branding consistency and applying it across different platforms.<br>
                    • Providing feedback on existing designs and suggesting visual improvements.<br>
                    • Although my title was “Social Media Design Intern,” the exposure I received extended beyond just aesthetics.<br><br>
                    I also learned about user experience (UX), responsive layouts, and the relationship between visual design and front-end
                    development.

            <div class="left box">
                <h4>Connection to Communication Technology</h4>
                <p>My major in Communication Technology integrates multimedia, web design and development. The internship, though centered
                on graphic design, was extremely relevant, because it emphasized visual storytelling, interface clarity, and
                communication through design—all fundamental to successful websites and apps.<br><br></p>

                <p>I came to understand how graphic design principles such as balance, alignment, contrast, hierarchy, and color theory
                directly inform web interface design. For instance, designing a print flyer with clear information flow helped me
                understand how to create intuitive layouts for websites. One designer I worked closely with always asked this question:
                “what do you want the audience/viewers to retain? The answer to this question led me to isolate a specific element – text or
                image - of the content to make it as appealing as possible. Similarly, working on branding elements taught me how
                consistency in color, typography, and imagery enhances user experience on digital platforms.</p><br>

                <p>This crossover between graphic design and communication technology became more evident as I progressed through the
                internship. I realized that strong design skills are not just complementary but foundational to modern web development.</p><br>

                <h4>Skills Gained</h4>
                <p>Here are some key skills I developed during my time at FraSca Design Group:</p><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Visual Design Software Proficiency:<br>
                        I became more comfortable using Canva pro, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. These tools helped me create
                        high-quality visuals that can be easily adapted into web elements, such as hero banners, icons, and UI components.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>Design Thinking and Creativity:<br>
                        I was exposed to real-world design challenges that required strategic thinking and creativity. Working on client briefs
                        forced me to consider audience, purpose, and medium—skills that are also critical when designing user-centered websites.
                        Restaurants want us to expose a meal or menu that makes them sound original. A company specialized in real state wants a
                        graphic that reflects the Jewish values, such as to wish “Happy Hannukah.”

                    </li>
                    <li>Attention to Detail:<br>
                        Designing print-ready materials taught me the importance of spacing, alignment, and pixel perfection though the latter
                        has remained a challenge to overcome. These habits naturally translated into my approach to coding front-end layouts
                        using HTML and CSS. Managing space has been a particular challenge to me since I have to so manually (instead of relying
                        on CSS to do so).
                    </li>
                    <li>Team Collaboration and Feedback:<br>
                        I learned to accept constructive criticism, which, in my case, came from people who would have been my children, and
                        revise designs based on feedback, an essential part of working in any tech or creative team. This skill is invaluable in
                        web development, where collaboration between designers and developers is key to producing polished digital products.

                    </li>
                    <li>Understanding Branding:<br>
                        Participating in branding projects helped me understand how to build design systems and style guides, which are crucial
                        in maintaining consistency across a website or app. I now appreciate the value of brand identity and how it drives
                        interface and interaction design.

                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Application to Web Design and Development
                    </h4>
                <p>The graphic design internship reinforced the importance of aesthetics and usability in web design. While technical
                coding skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are critical, a website’s success also depends on its visual appeal and how well
                it communicates its message. I learned, for instance, that the color palette and typography I choose when designing a
                website go beyond the visual aesthetic but define the identity of the company or the person that owns the website. Some
                specific areas where I saw improvement:</p><br>

                            <p>I began thinking more like a designer when coding. Instead of just focusing on structure and functionality, I now
                            prioritize user experience. I can say that I am now much aware about whitespace, typography, and content hierarchy.</p>

                                <p>Although I didn’t code websites during this internship, I designed assets that needed to be used across desktop and
                                mobile platforms. This taught me to think responsively, which directly applies to my work in responsive web development
                                using media queries and flexible layouts.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>Working with mockups and design specifications gave me insight into the process of translating static designs into live
                            websites. I became more adept at interpreting PSDs and design systems—a crucial skill for front-end developers.</p>

                            <p>Most of the work I completed during the internship has been published on FraSca’s company-clients: restaurants, law
                            firms and real state agencies. I in fact had to build my own design and requested that they are sanctioned by the team.</p>

                <h4>As a Summary
                </h4>
                <p>Adapting to a new workflow and design culture initially felt intimidating. I was nervous about whether my design ideas
                were good enough and whether I would be able to handle the software in use across the field. However, by observing and
                learning from seasoned professionals, I gradually gained confidence. Time management was another challenge—I had to meet
                strict deadlines and work on multiple projects at once. This helped me develop discipline and organizational skills that
                will benefit my future work as a freelance web developer or in an agency setting.</p><br>

                <p>My internship at FraSca Design Group was a transformative experience. It bridged the gap between theory and practice and
                showed me how visual design is an integral part of the web development process. I leave this experience with a stronger
                visual eye, a deeper appreciation for design strategy, and a clearer vision of how to combine my technical and creative
                skills.
                As I continue my learning a web developer role, I feel more prepared to take on complex projects that involve both
                coding and design. Whether I am building a responsive website, designing a landing page, or creating UI components, the
                lessons I learned at FraSca Design Group will remain at the core of my approach.</p>
