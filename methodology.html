            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>During the internship I wrote a weekly email to the artistic director about the evolution of my learning. Although he
            restrained himself from engaging into any open discussion with me upon the matter, reporting to him enabled me to assess
            the process. Thus, I every weekend told him about my appreciation of what was fine and explose and my plan of improvement for the weeks ahead. These emails were also a way for me to keep showing gratitude as I took it as a favor that he opened his companyâ€™s doors
            to me without having to provide any recommendation whatsoever from my school. Most importantly, these emails served as
            a memory aid for when writing this present final report.</p><br>
            <p>Below is one of the letters I wrote to Frank Scarpa in which I not only shown gratitude but also expressed my wish as
            the internship was going on:</p><br>
